## h5 playwithtable.py
This file acts as a user interface, allowing the person who runs it to search
and manipulate the database created with tablecreation.py. It should be run
with python3 in the command line interface with psycopg2 and Postico running in
the background. The command line should be full screen to provide the tables
with sufficient room.
